        # dist.ini
        [Pod2Html]

        # or
        [Pod2Html]
        dir = my_docs   ; where to create HTML files

        # or

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin generates HTML pages from the POD files and puts them into
    the distribution in a separate directory (not as a tree of files but
    flatten). The created HTML pages have the same (or, at least, similar)
    style as the modules' documentation shown at CPAN.

    It creates HTML pages from all files in the "lib" and "bin" directory
    that contain a POD section and that have ".pm" or ".pl" extension or
    that have the word "perl" in their first line. The plugin is run after
    other plugins that may munge files and create the POD sections (such as
    *PodWeaver*).

ATTRIBUTES
    All attributes are optional.

   dir
    This attribute changes the destination of the generated HTML files. It
    is a directory (or even a path) relative to the distribution root
    directory. Default value is "docs". For example:

        [Pod2Html]
        dir = docs/html

   ignore
    This attribute allows to ignore some input files that would be otherwise
    converted to HTML. Its value is a file name that should be ignored
    (relative to the distribution root directory). By default no
    (appropriate) files are ignored. The attribute can be repeated if you
    wish to ignore more files. For example:

        [Pod2Html]
        ignore = lib/My/Sample.pm
        ignore = bin/obscure-script

SUBCLASSING
    New plugins can be created by subclassing this plugin. The subclass may
    consider to overwrite following methods:

   is_interesting_file ($file)
    The method decides (by returning something or undef) whether the given
    file should be a candidate for the conversion to the HTML. The parameter
    is a blessed object with the "Dist::Zilla::Role::File" role.

   pod2html ($file)
    This method does the conversion to the HTML (using module
    "Pod::Simple::HTML"). It gets an input file (a blessed object with the
    "Dist::Zilla::Role::File" role) and it should return a converted
    content. By overwriting this method a new plugin can make any
    conversion, to anything.

   get_css_style
    It returns a string containing CSS-style definitions. The string will be
    used in the "head" section of the created HTML file. See its default
    value in the *__DATA__* section of this module.
